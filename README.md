# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

In this Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning Project, I have Created a Classification Model to predict if a Patient is Diabetic(Yes-0) or Not-Diabetic(No-1)

# Objective:

The objective of this Project is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various Variables available in the dataset.

variables include: 

* Number of Pregnancies,
* Insulin Level,  
* Age, 
* BMI etc.

The data set that has used in this project has taken from the kaggle .

"This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

# Technologies Used : -
Python 3.7

Pandas

Numpy
